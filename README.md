There seems to be some sort of pattern in this graph. If a coach were to be paid from $0 to $2M, the WinLoss % ranges from 0.3 to 1, and the coach's salary were to be from $2M to $4M, the WinLoss % ranges from 0.3 to 1 as well. Showing that there is no difference in paying your coach anymore than $2M if the performance of his school is from 0.3 to 1. However, if the coach were to be paid $4M or more, the range for WinLoss % is from about 0.6 to 1.
